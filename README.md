# 👋 Hey, I'm Zeta

Software engineer with 15+ years building stuff. I've been through startups, led engineering teams, and spent way too many hours writing code. These days I'm working on AI voice agents as well as my own projects.

```javascript
const zeta = {
    role: "Software Engineer",
    experience: "15+ years",
    currentlyInto: ["AI agents", "Automation", "Building products"],
    alsoInto: ["☕ Specialty coffee", "🚴 Gravel cycling"]
};
```

## 💼 What I do

I work mostly on full-stack development with a lot of AI integration lately. Been experimenting with LLMs, building workflows with AI agents, and automating processes that shouldn't need manual work. It's a mix of regular web development and figuring out where AI actually adds value versus where it's just hype.

I care about the product side as much as the technical side. What are we building? Why does it matter? Who's going to use it? Those questions shape how I approach projects. Code is just one piece of the puzzle.

## 🛠️ My background

I've done full-stack development for most of my career—frontends, backends, APIs, databases, system architecture, the whole deal. I've also led engineering teams and mentored developers, which taught me that good software is as much about people as it is about code.

Lately I've been deep into AI and automation. Working with APIs from OpenAI and Anthropic, building agents that can handle complex workflows, and trying to separate the signal from the noise in this space. It's exciting but there's a lot of figuring things out as you go.

## 💭 What I think about

I spend a lot of time thinking about how to actually ship products, not just build features. How do you go from an idea to something people use? What makes the difference between a side project that dies and one that becomes a real business? 

I'm also interested in AI agents in production environments, software architecture (the boring but important stuff), and entrepreneurship. Basically, the intersection of building things and making them sustainable.

Oh, and I'm probably too into specialty coffee ☕ and gravel cycling 🚴. If you want to talk about either of those, I'm all ears.

## 🤝 Let's connect

Always up for chatting about technical challenges, product ideas, AI stuff, or just exchanging thoughts on building things. Hit me up here on GitHub or check out my repos.
